## Project Overview

This project provides a practical demonstration of deploying an AI model using Kubernetes and monitoring its performance in real-time with Prometheus and Grafana. The setup showcases containerized deployment, metric collection, and visualization, making it suitable for production-level insights and management.

## Scope

#### What Won't Be Covered
This application assumes a foundational understanding of certain tools and concepts. Therefore, it will not cover:

- **Basic Concepts of Kubernetes**: This guide won’t explain Kubernetes fundamentals such as pods, deployments, and services.
- **Introduction to Docker**: Basic Docker concepts like containers, images, and volumes are assumed knowledge and will not be explained in detail.
- **Setting Up Grafana Dashboards from Scratch**: We will focus on integrating Prometheus data into Grafana but won't cover creating dashboards from the ground up.
- **Prometheus Fundamentals**: The basics of Prometheus, including metric types and querying, will not be the focus.
- **FastAPI Basics**: This project uses FastAPI for the application layer but will not delve into FastAPI setup or syntax.

This guide focuses primarily on deploying, monitoring, and visualizing application metrics rather than introducing these tools from scratch.

## Key Components
- FastAPI: Serves the AI model for inference requests.
- Docker: Rrunning the FastAPI application in containers.
- Kubernetes: Manages the containerized application, providing scalability and reliability.
- Prometheus: Collects performance metrics, including custom metrics from the FastAPI application.
- Grafana: Visualizes real-time metrics from Prometheus, enabling comprehensive monitoring of the AI model’s performance.


## Model Details

The AI model used for this demonstration is [deit-base-distilled-patch16-224](https://huggingface.co/facebook/deit-base-distilled-patch16-224) by Meta, a distilled vision transformer model optimized for efficient image classification tasks.

## Prerequisites
- Docker
- Helm
- Kubernetes (Minikube or any K8s cluster)
- Prometheus & Grafana
- Python 3.x

## Project Structure
- `src/`: Contains the AI model inference code (e.g., `app.py`).
- `k8s/`: Contains Kubernetes deployment and service YAML files.
- `Dockerfile`: Docker configuration for containerizing the AI model.
- `README.md`: Instructions for setting up and deploying the project.

```

### 4. Build Docker Image

#### 1. Deploy to Minikube environment:
If Minikube is running successfully, ensure Docker is using Minikube’s environment:

```bash
# Change the docker environment
eval $(minikube docker-env)
```

#### 2. Build docker image:
```bash
docker build -t deploy-ai-models-with-kubernetes-app:latest .
```

#### 3. Deploy to Kubernetes: 
```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/fastapi_app/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/fastapi_app/service.yaml
```

### 5. Configure Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

#### 1. Install Prometheus:
```bash 
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
helm install prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus
```

#### 2. Deploy Prometheus
```bash[alt text](<Screenshot from 2024-10-30 21-09-12.png>)
kubectl apply -f k8s/prometheus/prometheus-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/prometheus/prometheus-service.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/prometheus/prometheus-config.yaml
```

#### 3. Install Grafana
```bash
helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
helm install grafana grafana/grafana
```

#### 4. Deploy Grafana
```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/grafana/grafana-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/grafana/grafana-service.yaml
```

#### 5. Access Prometheus & Grafana
```bash
minikube service prometheus-service --url # To access prometheus URL.
minikube service grafana-service --url # To access grafana URL.
```

### 6. Verify Kubernetes pods
Run the following command:
```bash
kubectl get pods
```
All FastAPI, Prometheus and Grafana pods should show a status of Running.

#### Debug the pods
In case a pod is pending or failing, you can always check the logs

```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```

## Prometheus to Scrape Application Metrics
In order to monitoring a specific application (e.g., FastAPI), we'll need to update the Prometheus scrape configuration to include the application’s info/metrics endpoint. 

<b>Note:</b> The script is already written, no need to do anything from your side.

#### 1. Setting up Scraping jobs:
Here, we are setting a job for prometheus to scrape matrics from the FastAPI application. 
```bash
scrape_configs:
    - job_name: 'fastapi-app'
    static_configs:
        - targets: ['fastapi-service:8000']  # Replace with FastAPI service name and port
    metrics_path: info/metrics  # Path to scrape metrics from FastAPI
```

And here, we are setting a new job to scrape data from the kubernets cluster such as CPU and Memory usage

```bash
scrape_configs:
    - job_name: 'node'
    static_configs:
        - targets: ['prometheus-prometheus-node-exporter:9100','prometheus-kube-state-metrics:8080','kube-state-metrics:8080']
```

#### 2. Jobs Demo
Here are the jobs which we defined in the prometheus-config.yaml.

#### 3. Matrics Demo
Here is a snippet showing the memory usage by the node.

## Setting up Grafana to Visualize Prometheus data
Grafana supports querying Prometheus, using the default port http://localhost:3000, and the default login credentials "admin" / "admin". [Official guide to connect both frameworks](https://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/grafana/).


#### 1. Grafana Dashboards:
Import Pre-built Dashboards, as Grafana has many community dashboards for Prometheus metrics, Node Exporter, Kubernetes, etc.

In this project, we are using the [Node Exporter](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/1860-node-exporter-full/) dashboard. 

![kubernetes_pods](/static/images/grafana_visualization.png)

#### 2. Customize Dashboards
We can create custom panels to display specific metrics, with regard to the FastAPI applications such as:

- API response time. 
- File sizes. 
- Average response time. 

## Setting up Alerts for Prometheus
we configured Prometheus to monitor application availability using an alert rule. The setup involved the following steps:

#### 1. Creating the Alert Rule
We defined an alert rule in alert-rules.yaml to detect when a target application goes down. The rule triggers an alert if the up metric is 0 for more than 1 minute, indicating that Prometheus cannot reach the target. Here’s the alert rule we used:

```bash
groups:
  - name: cpu_alerts
    rules:
      - alert: server_is_down
        expr: up == 0
        for: 1m
        labels:
          severity: page
        annotations:
          summary: "Server is down"
```

#### 2. Configuring Prometheus to Load the Alert Rule
We created a ConfigMap for `alert-rules.yaml` and mounted it in the Prometheus container under `/etc/prometheus/alert-rules.yaml`. The Prometheus configuration (`prometheus.yml`) was updated to include this file in the `rule_files` section.

#### 3. Verifying and Testing
After setting up the rule, we confirmed it was loaded correctly by checking the Alerts section in the Prometheus UI. We also tested the alert by simulating a target going down, and verified that the alert fired as expected.
